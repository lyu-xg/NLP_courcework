;; DATA DEFINITIONS

(define-struct ball (x y radius selected?))

;; A Ball is a (make-ball Number Number Number Boolean)
;; x and y are the coordinates of the center of the ball, in pixels,
;; relative to the origin of the scene.
;; radius is the radius of the ball, in pixels
;; selected? is true iff the ball has been selected for dragging.

;; TEMPLATE:
;; (define (ball-fn b)
;;   (...
;;     (ball-x b)
;;     (ball-y b)
;;     (ball-radius b)
;;     (ball-selected? b)))

;; balls-intersect? : Ball Ball -> Boolean
;; GIVEN: two balls
;; ANSWERS: do the balls intersect?
;; STRATEGY: Structural Decomposition on b1 b2 : Ball
(define (would-balls-collide? b1 b2)
  (circles-intersect?
    (ball-x b1) (ball-y b1) (ball-radius b1)
    (ball-x b2) (ball-y b2) (ball-radius b2)))

;; would-circles-collide? : Real^3 Real^3 -> Boolean
;; GIVEN: two positions and radii
;; ANSWERS: Would two circles with the given positions and radii intersect?
;; STRATEGY: Function Composition
(define (would-circles-collide? x1 y1 r1 x2 y2 r2)
  (<=
    (+
      (sqr (- x1 x2))
      (sqr (- y1 y2)))
    (sqr (+ r1 r2))))

;; would-circles-collide? knows about geometry.  It doesn't know about
;; balls: eg it doesn't know the field names of Ball or about
;; ball-selected?.

;; If we changed the representation of balls, to add color, text, or
;; to change the names of the fields, would-circles-collide? wouldn't
;; need to change.
