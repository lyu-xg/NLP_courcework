;; velocity-at-time : Real Real Real -> Real
;; PURPOSE:
;; GIVEN: initial velocity v0, acceleration a, and time t,
;; in any compatible set of units. 
;; RETURNS: the velocity at time t.
;; EXAMPLES:
; (velocity-at-time 10 20 0) = 10
; (velocity-at-time 10 20 2) = 50
;; STRATEGY: combine simpler functions
