<h1>The Luggage Scanner Problem</h1>

<p>Your task is to design a program that determines whether a suitcase
will fit through an X-ray scanner at the airport.
</p>

<p>We assume the suitcase is a rectangular solid, and the mouth of the
scanner is a rectangle.  We also assume that it doesn't matter how
long the suitcase is, so long as there is some way to feed it through
the scanner.</p>

<p>Here is the contract and purpose statement:</p>

<pre>
suitcase-fits-scanner : Suitcase Scanner -> Boolean
GIVEN: a Suitcase and a Scanner
RETURNS: true iff the suitcase can fit through the scanner.
</pre>
