<p>This course will be run utilizing a "flipped-classroom" model.  In this
   model, students will complete reading assignments at home in an
   online format. The online portion of this course is intended to
   replace your weekly lecture meetings. Instead, students will meet
   once a week on-campus with the instructor in gatherings that are
   devoted to exercises, projects, and discussion.</p>

<p>The primary advantage to this model is that it allows an instructor
   to spend less time simply lecturing to students and more time
   working with them on questions and thoughts they have on the
   material. We believe that it will truly enhance the learning
   experience in this and in future courses.  </p>

 <p>Here are the details:</p>

  <ol>

    <li>The course consists of 13 modules, numbered 0 through 12.</li>

    <li>The week runs from Monday to Sunday.</li>

    <li>Each module consists of:<p></p>
    <ul class="condensed">
      <li>a reading assignment</li>
      <li>online materials</li>
      <li>a 2-hour classroom meeting</li>
      <li>a problem set</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Each week you will have an online assignment posted on the
 course web site.  This will consist of a combination of video
 lectures, PowerPoint presentations, and possibly other media.  This
 replaces the usual 3-hour lecture.

  <p><span style="color:red"><strong> You will be responsible for
 studying this material before you come to class.</strong></span></p>

  <p> As you go through these materials, you are sure to have
    questions.  Please post them on the discussion board in <a
    href="https://piazza.com/northeastern/fall2016/cs5010/home"
    >Piazza</a>.</p>  </li>

    <li>The weekly assignment will may also include some Guided
    Practice exercises.  We strongly urge you to do these exercises,
    since they give you a quick way of checking your understanding.
    In some cases the exercises contain new material, so you won't get
    the whole story unless you do the exercises. </li>

    <li>The weekly classroom meeting will be devoted to:
    <p></p>
    <ul class="condensed">
      <li>Review of previous topics, as needed</li>
      <li>in-class exercises and other enrichment on this week's materials</li>
      <li>Questions and answers.  You can ask the instructor
      questions, but the instructor may ask you questions also.  <span style="color:red">Be prepared to be called on

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>No new material will be presented in class. </strong></p>
  </li>

  <li> Problem Sets are assigned weekly.  They will usually come out
  on Monday (or perhaps earlier) and be due at 6pm local time the
  following Monday.  Familiarize yourself with the <a
  href="deliverables.html" >homework deliverables</a> and <a
  href="homework.html" >submission procedures</a>.  The problem sets
  are designed to take about 20 hours a week (!), so organize your
  time accordingly.  If you have questions, ask them early.  The best
  place to do this is on Piazza. </li>

  <li>Later in the week following the due date of each
    problem set, you will give an oral presentation of approximately
    15 minutes on your solution.  We call these presentations
    "codewalks." You will do this in groups of 4 students.

  <p>  During this presentation, you will be questioned by a TA on
    selected aspects of your solution.  These presentations are
    critical for the learning process and they are key to our
    evaluation of your progress. </p>

  <p>There will be some evening codewalk slots for students who work
  full-time.
  
  </li>

  <li>

    <p>You will be issued a personal, private URL that you can use to set
    your code walk time slot preferences. There is online help
    available within the web-based tool. Please try to keep your
    "flexibility" score as high as you can: doing so maximizes the
    chances you are assigned a slot you will be happy with. </p>

    <p>Every Sunday at 11.59pm we will take a snapshot of your preferences
    and compute a code walk schedule for the following week. You
    will be sent email (to your @ccs.neu.edu account) informing you of
    your time slot for the week. </p>

    <p>If you lose your URL, contact the course staff.
  
  </li>

  <li>Your solution will be graded using a <a
  href="master-rubric-public.txt" >detailed rubric</a>.  
  You will be judged on <p></p>

  <ul class="condensed">
    <li>adherence to coding & documentation standards
    <li>appropriate use of tools & techniques
    <li>your ability to explain your program and your design decisions 	
  </ul>
  </li>

  </ol>
