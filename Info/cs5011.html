<h1>CS 5011: Lab for Programming Design Paradigms</h1>

<p> The course comes with a <em>lab course</em>, called CS
 5011. Students must register for both courses to receive credit.
 </p>

<p>This course number exists only for bureaucratic reasons.  It will
meet as a course <em>only twice</em>,
<!-- on the weeks of September 5 and -->
<!-- September 12, -->
on <strong>September 8-9 and September 15-16, 2016</strong>,
at the times and places listed by the Registrar.
(Schedule in Seattle may differ). After that, it is replaced by your
weekly codewalk.</p>

<p>The CS 5011 meetings will serve as an opportunity for you to get
help installing your <a href="software.html" >software</a>, and to
take questions about <a href="../Modules/module00.html" >Module
00</a>.</p>

<p>You may attend any section of CS 5011 you like. Attendance at CS
5011 is optional.  If you don't need the help, either with software
installation or with Module 00, you don't need to go.</p>
