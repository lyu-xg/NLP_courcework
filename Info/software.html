<h1>Preparing Your Laptop For CS5010</h1>

<p> You will need to do several things to get your machine ready for
CS 5010.  If you have difficulty with any of them, we will
help you at the first meeting of CS 5011.  </p>

<p>If you do not have a laptop or personal computer, you still need to
do all the steps here except for those that require you to install
software on your local computer.</p>

<ol>

    <li><strong>Sign up for a CCIS account.</strong> Follow the
  instructions <a
  href="http://howto.ccs.neu.edu/howto/accounts-homedirs/how-to-sign-up-for-a-ccis-account/"
  >here</a>.

  This may take up to 48 hours, so start this process as soon as you
  can.

  <p>A word of advice: Once you choose a username, you can't change
  it, so choose wisely. Employers are likely to be communicating with
  you via your CCIS username, so choose a name that is professional.
  <kbd>Drinkzmore</kbd>, for example, would be a bad choice. </p>

  </li>

  <li><strong>If you do not have a copy of PowerPoint, please get
  one.</strong> All Northeastern students have free access to
  Microsoft Office 365 for Windows and Macs.  Please access this via
  the Office 365 channel in myNeu under self-service or directly
  through the <a
  href="https://portal.office.com/?realm=northeastern.edu" >Office 365
  portal</a>. Your Office 365 username is [your myNEU
  username]@northeastern.edu. </p> 

  <p/></li>

  <li><strong>Sign up for CS 5010 on piazza.com at <a href="
  https://piazza.com/northeastern/fall2016/cs5010/home" >
  https://piazza.com/northeastern/fall2016/cs5010/home</a>.</strong>  Please
  use your CCIS email as your Piazza login. We will
  be using Piazza as our primary vehicle for online discussion. Be
  sure to read the notes about <a href="netiquette.html"
  >communication</a>.<p/>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Make sure your wireless is working.</strong>  Make sure
  you can connect to one of the following networks:
  <p/>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>NUWave</strong>: You will need your husky.neu.edu
  credentials.  Available all over campus.</li>
  
  <li><strong>NUWave-Guest</strong>: Like NUWave, but does not require
  credentials.  You will need to accept the usage agreement every time
  you connect.</li>
  
  <!-- Wed Jul 20 17:21:11 2016: these are redundant. -->
  <!-- <li><strong>CCIS-Wireless</strong>: Log in with your myNeu -->
  <!-- credentials.  You should be able to store your credentials so you -->
  <!-- only need to authenticate once.  Available only in -->
  <!-- WVH.</li> -->

  <!-- <li><strong>CCIS-Wireless-Guest</strong>: Log in on a splash page -->
  <!-- with your myNeu credentials.  Available only in WVH.</li> -->

  <li>FYI, Northeastern is a particpant in <a
  href="http://www.northeastern.edu/its/services/networks/eduroam/"
  >eduroam</a>, which gives you access to the Wifi at any of the
  thousands of partipating institution worldwide.  </li>
  

</ul><p/>
  </li>



  <li><strong>Download and Install Racket on your laptop.</strong> Go
      to <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org" target=_blank
      >www.racket-lang.org</a> and download and install the latest
      version of Racket (version 6.6, July 2016).  Racket is available
      for Windows (32 and 64-bit), Mac OS X, and Linux.  Choose the version that is
      right for your system. <p/> </li>

  <li><strong>Activate your <a href="https://github.ccs.neu.edu"
  >CCIS Github</a> account.</strong> We will be using github as our repository and
  version control system in this course.  To use github, you will need
  to do a few things: </p>

      <ul>

	<li> Go to <a href="https://github.ccs.neu.edu"
  >https://github.ccs.neu.edu</a> and log in using your CCIS credentials. </li>

	<li> Download and install a github client.  We recommend <a
	href="http://desktop.github.com/" >Github Desktop</a> for Mac
	and Windows. If you are using Linux, use the git package that
	came with your linux distribution.  </li>

	<li> Upload a picture of yourself to your github.ccs.neu.edu
      profile.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Make sure your machine is set to the Eastern Time
      Zone (currently UTC-04:00).  If you are in Seattle, please make
      sure your machine is set to Pacific Time (currently
      UTC-07:00).</strong>  This will ensure that your commits are
      logged with the correct time.</li>
      </ul>

</ul>
</li>
