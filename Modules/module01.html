<h1>CS 5010 Module 01</h1>

<h2>Module Overview</h2>

<p>This week we will learn about the Function Design Recipe.  The
Function Design Recipe is a technique that will help you achieve the
goal of this course: to write beautiful programs.</p>

<p>The Function Design Recipe has 6 steps:
</p>

<ol class="condensed">
  <li>Data Design</li>
  <li>Contract and Purpose Statement</li>
  <li>Examples and Tests</li>
  <li>Design Strategy</li>
  <li>Function Definition</li>
  <li>Program Review</li>
</ol>

<p>We will spend most of the week (Lessons 1.2-1.5) on Step 1, Data
Design.  We will write down a recipe for doing a data design, and we
wil learn about templates, which enable us to process data by simply
filling in the blanks.</p>

<p>We will learn about the other steps of the design recipe, and we
will learn about the first of our design strategies, combining simpler
functions.</p>

<h2>Readings</h2>

<p>Prologue and Part I from the <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html" >textbook</a>, which cover an
introduction to programming, fixed-size data, and the Basic Student
Language in Racket.
</p>

<p>Here's some <a
href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2016/06/16/long-names-are-long/"
>advice</a> from a Googler on choosing good names.  I'm not sure I
agree with all his advice, but he's on the right track.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<ul>

  <li><a href="../Examples" >Examples for Week
  01</a> The example programs for each week will be found in the <a
  href="../Examples" >Examples</a> section of this website.  Please
  especially note the <a href="../Examples/LICENSE" >LICENSE</a>,
  which sets out the terms under which you may use these files.

  <p>This entire website is available at github as <a

  We recommend that you clone it and pull the changes every week so
  you will always have a complete set of example programs.
