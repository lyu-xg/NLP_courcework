<h1>Guided Practice 2.2: The Prisoner's Dilemma</h1>



<p>Two men are arrested, but the police do not possess enough
information for a conviction. The police separate the two men and
offer each the same deal- if one testifies
against his partner (betrays), and the other stays quiet
(doesn't betray), the betrayer goes free and the non-betrayer receives
the full one-year sentence. If both remain silent, both are
sentenced to only one month in jail for a minor charge. If each
'rats out' the other, each receives a three-month sentence. Each
prisoner must choose to either betray or remain silent; the
decision of each is kept quiet. What should they do?  
</p>


<p>The outcomes for player 1 are:
</p>

<pre>
                           Player 2 move: 
                         Betray    Don't Betray
 Player 1 move:
 --------------------+------------------------
 Betray              |    -3        0
 --------------------+------------------------
 Don't Betray        |   -12       -1       
 --------------------+------------------------
</pre>

<p>Observe that for both player 1 and player 2, the "right" thing to
do is to betray, since that avoids the possibility of -12.  But of
course if nobody betrays, they both wind up with only a month in
jail-- a better outcome!
</p>

<p>This problem has been the subject of much discussion and research.
Let's take a look at a small piece of the problem.</p>



<pre>
;; DATA DEFINITIONS

;; A Move is one of 
;; -- "betray"
;; -- "don't betray"

;; move-fn : Move -> ???
;; (define (move-fn m)
;;   (cond
;;     [(string=? m "betray") ...]
;;     [(string=? m "don't betray") ...]))
</pre>

<p>Here's the task:</p>

<pre>
;;; outcome : Move Move -> Number
;;; GIVEN: the moves of player 1 and player 2
;;; RETURNS: the outcome for player 1
;;; EXAMPLES: (outcome "betray" "don't betray") = 0.
;;; see table above.
</pre>


<p>Here's how NOT to do it:
</p>

<pre>
(define (outcome move1 move2)
  (cond
    [(string=? move1 "betray")
     (cond
       [(string=? move2 "betray") -3]
       [(string=? move2 "don't betray") 0])]
    [(string=? move1 "don't betray")
     (cond
       [(string=? move2 "betray") -12]
       [(string=? move2 "don't betray") -1])]))

;; TESTS:
(begin-for-test
  (check-equal? (outcome "betray" "betray") -3)
  (check-equal? (outcome "betray" "don't betray") 0)
  (check-equal? (outcome "don't betray" "betray") -12)
  (check-equal? (outcome "don't betray" "don't betray") -1))

</pre>

<p>This code violates our rule that you can only use one template at a
time.  It starts out using the template for Move on move1, but then in
the right-hand sides of the cond, it starts using the template for
Move on move2.  We can't apply the exception mentioned in the slides
for Lesson 2.3, because Move is not compound data. </p>

<p>Rewrite this code to follow the template by splitting each of the
right-hand sides into a separate help function.  Be sure to use good
function names for your help functions.</p>
