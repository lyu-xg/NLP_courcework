<h1>Guided Practice 8.2</h1>

<p>True/False: Which of the following is a valid halting measure for
<kbd>even-elements</kbd>, and why?</p>

<ol>
  <li>the largest element of lst </li>
  <li>the number of distinct elements of lst</li>
  <li>the sum of the elements of lst</li>
  <li>the length of lst</li>
</ol>

<h2>Answers:</h2>

<ol>
  
  <li>False.  If the largest element is far down in the list, taking
(rest (rest lst)) will not change the value of the largest element.
For example, consider lst = (list 12 11 5 17 12 11).  The largest
element in lst is 17, but the largest element in (rest (rest lst)) is
still 17.  </li>

  <li>False. If the first two elements are both duplicated farther
down in the list, then taking (rest (rest lst)) will not change the
number of distinct elements.  </li>
  
  <li> False.  If the first two elements are both 0, then the sum of
the elements will not change.  </li>
 
  <li> True. The length of a list is always a non-negative integer,
and the length decreases by two at every recursive call.  </li>

</ol>
