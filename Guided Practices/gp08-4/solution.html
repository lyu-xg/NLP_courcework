<h1>Guided Practice 8.4</h1>

<p>All we need to do is to redefine <kbd>successors</kbd>.  For
example, we could write</p>

<pre>
;; Node Graph -> ListOfNode
;; STRATEGY: Use template for Graph on g
(define (successors n1 g)
  (cond
    [(empty? g) empty]
    [else (if (node=? (node-info-node (first g)) n1)
              (node-info-successors (first g))
              (successors n1 (rest g)))]))

;; NodeInfo -> Node
;; Use template for NodeInfo on i
(define (node-info-node i)
  (first i))

;; NodeInfo -> ListOfNode
;; Use template for NodeInfo on i
(define  (node-info-successors i)
  (rest i))

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; Of course, these help functions are very simple, so we might inline
;; them and write

;; Node Graph -> ListOfNode
;; STRATEGY: Use template for Graph on g
(define (successors n1 g)
  (cond
    [(empty? g) empty]
    [else (if (node=? (first (first g)) n1)
              (rest (first g))
              (successors n1 (rest g)))]))

</pre>

<p>Do you think the second version is clearer or less clear than the
first one?  If the person you who followed you in your job had to
maintain this code, how hard would it be for him or her to figure out
the meaning of (first (first g)) ?  What could be done to improve this
code?
</p>
