<h1>Guided Practice 1.1 - Solution</h1>

<p>The question was:</p>

<p>Classify each of the following kinds of information as one of:</p>

<ul class="condensed">
  <li>Scalar</li>
  <li>Itemization</li>
  <li>Compound</li>
  <li>Mixed</li>
</ul>



<p>Solutions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A weight: Weight is a number, therefore it is scalar information
  </li>
  
  <li>A guitar in a guitar shop's inventory: The information for a
  guitar might consist of type, make, model, year, serial number, and
  probably other information as well; therefore it is compound
  information.  </li>

  <li>A day of the week: There are exactly seven days in a week, so
  there are exactly seven possible values. Therefore it is itemization
  information.</li>

  <li>An order in a restaurant: In a restaurant, there are several
  dishes on the menu. For each kind of dish (steak, salad, sandwich)
  we probably need to include several items of information, such as
  quantity, price, plus special information for each dish (e.g. rare,
  medium, or well-done for a steak, "dressing on the side" for a
  salad, or kind of bread for a sandwich). So we have several variants
  of information (one per menu item), each of which is compound
  information. Therefore it is classified as mixed information.</li>

  
  <li> An automobile in a dealer's showroom: The information for an
  automobile might consist of make, model, year, serial number, and
  probably other information as well; therefore it is compound
  information.</li>
  

  <li>A College Degree: The answer depends on the application. Perhaps
  we just need to keep track of the level of the degree: bachelor's,
  master's or Ph.D. That would be itemization information. Or we might
  need to keep track of both the level and major. That would be
  compound information. Or we might want to allow 'None' as a
  possibility and still keep track of the level and major. That would
  be mixed information.  Or perhaps we're talking about a particular
  student's degree, in which case we might want to keep track of the
  date as well.</li> 

</ol>

<p>Note that the same kinds of arguments we made about the College
Degree could be made almost as easily for some of the other examples
as well.  Data Design could be (and often is) a whole course by itself.</p>
