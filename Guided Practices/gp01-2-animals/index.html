<h1>Guided Practice 1.2</h1>

<p>Here is an example based on Exercise 94 from HtDP/2e:</p>

<p>Design a data representation for the following four kinds of zoo
animals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> spiders, whose relevant attributes are the number of
  remaining legs (we assume that spiders can lose legs in accidents)
  and the space they need in case of transport; </li>

  <li>elephants, whose only attributes are the space they need in case
  of transport; </li>

  <li>boa constrictor, whose attributes include length and girth; and</li>

  <li>armadillo, for whom you must determine appropriate attributes;
  they need to include attributes that determine space needed for
  transportation. </li>

</ul>

<p>Write a data definition for ZooAnimal. Be sure to include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Structure Definitions  </li>
  <li>Constructor Template</li>
  <li>Interpretation</li>
  <li>Observer Template</li>
  <li>Examples</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here is a <a href="01-2-animals-solution.rkt" >solution</a>.  But
remember, no peeking! You won't get anything out of this exercise if
you don't write down your solution first.
