;; to follow Lesson 7.2

;; design a function

;; diff : NonEmptyListOfNumber -> Number
;; GIVEN: a nonempty list of numbers
;; RETURNS: the result of subtracting the numbers, from left to right.
;; EXAMPLE:
;; (diff (list 10 5 3)) = 2

;; Hints:  

;; Use the data definition

;; NonEmptyListOfNumber = (cons Number ListOf<Number>)

;; You will need one function for the whole list, and one for the
;; ListOf<Number>.

;; Your function for the ListOf<Number> must follow the template for
;; ListOf<Number>, but you will need a context argument.  Think carefully
;; about what the context argument means.
